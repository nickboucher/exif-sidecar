# XMP Tool

This tool will create an XMP sidecar file for any media files in a specified directory that are missing date/time metadata. It will also link "Live Photos" to their corresponding video files.

This tool is designed for users of [immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich), although it can also be used independently. The motivation for this tool is [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/). When selecting "Download All" from an album in Google Photos, the resulting zip file:
- Removes EXIF metadata from some media files, particularly videos.
- Unlinks "Live Photos" from their corresponding video files by stripping key metadata.

`xmptool` is designed to automatically correct these issues by bulk creating XMP sidecar files for media files missing date/time metadata and linking "Live Photos" to their corresponding video files.

Date/time metadata is inferred from surrounding files in the directory containing this information. "Live Photos" without links to the corresponding video file are corrected by adding a Content Identifier to the XMP sidecar file. No changes are made to the original media files: all edits are stored a separate XMP sidecar files which are compatible with [immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich).

## Usage
